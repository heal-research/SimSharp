    <Description>Sim# aims to port the concepts used in SimPy (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpy) to the .NET world. It is implemented in C# and builds on the .NET Framework 4.5 / .NET Standard 2.0. Sim# uses an efficient event queue (adapted from https://github.com/BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp). The MachineShop benchmark comes close to 3.5 million events per second on a Core i7-7 2.7Ghz.

Sim# allows modeling processes easily and with little boiler plate code. A process is described as a method that yields events. When an event is yielded, the process waits on it. Processes are themselves events and so it is convenient to spawn sub-processes that can either be waited upon or that run next to each other. There is no need to inherit from classes or understand a complex object oriented design.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>Sim# 3.3 adds a pseudo realtime simulation environment which is derived from ThreadSafeSimulation. This new environment is very flexible and may dynamically change speed from running in virtual time to running in scaled realtime. It does not provide a realtime guarantee however. It introduces a wall clock delay that is equal to the difference between the next event's date and the current simulation time. It uses a Stopwatch to track the current time while the simulation is delayed.

A very rare bug has been fixed with respect to generating normal-distributed random numbers. It could arise in thread-safe simulations with asynchronous interactions and multiple sources of randomness, i.e., multiple RNGs.</PackageReleaseNotes>
